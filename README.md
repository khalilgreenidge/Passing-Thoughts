# Passing Thoughts

What if you could post something and know it wouldnâ€™t live forever? In this project, I have built a place for our passing thoughts. Once you add a short thought, itâ€™ll disappear after just 15 seconds.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Add a thought in the input field and click the `add` button. Wait for 15 secs. Ta-Da! ðŸŽ‰

Happy Coding ðŸ™‚
